# rvepp
rvepp stands for RISC Versatile Endpoint Protection. This project picks up from some prior research I was doing on ARMv7 IoT devices several years ago. Balancing proper classification of malware vs. benign files, all while using as few resources as possible.

At present, I have both a RPI 5 and a Waveshare VisionFive2 SBC to build and test on initially, though I am hoping to get both more and less powerful SBCs in time.

## Target Requirements
Initially, given the market right now I am going to target only Ubuntu, but eventually this could be expanded into NetBSD or others.
